## End-to-End DevSecOps Kubernetes Project using AWS, Jenkins CICD Pipeline

#### Today we will be deploying a Netflix clone! We will be using a variety of tools to automate the build, test, and deployment process, as well as to monitor the health of our application.

##### Here are the tools we will be using:

+ DevOps: DevOps Practices combines software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) to improve efficiency of software delivery.
+ GitHub: This is the source control system that would allow us to track changes to our code and collaborate with teammate.
+ Jenkins: This is a continuous integration (CI) tool that will automate the build, test, and deployment of our application.
+ Docker: This is the container Image platform that will allow us to package our application and its dependencies into a portable unit.
+ Kubernetes: This is an container orchestration platform that will automate the deployment, scaling, and management of our containerized application.
+ SonarQube: This is a code quality tool that will help us identify bugs and security vulnerabilities in our code.
+ SonarQube Analysis: This is a SonarQube plugin that will analyze our code and provide us with reports on its quality.
+ NPM: This is a package manager for JavaScript code.
+ Trivy: This is a vulnerability scanner for container images.
+ OWASP Dependency File Scan: This is a tool that can scan our code for known vulnerabilities in open source libraries.
+ Docker Build: This is a command that will build a Docker image from our code.
+ Image Push: This is a command that will push our Docker image to a registry.
+ Deploy on Container: This is a command that will deploy our Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.
+ Deploy to Kubernetes: This is a command that will deploy our Kubernetes manifest files to a Kubernetes cluster.
+ Monitoring: This is the process of collecting and analyzing data about the performance and health of our application.
+ Grafana: This is a visualization tool that will allow us to create dashboards to view our monitoring data.
+ Prometheus: This is a monitoring system that collects data from our application and stores it in a time series database.
+ Node exporter: This is a Prometheus exporter that collects data about the performance of our Node.js application.

###### Steps to Implement the Project:

+ Step 1 — Launch an Ubuntu(22.04) T2 Large Instance
+ Step 2 — Install Jenkins, Docker, and Trivy. Create a Sonarqube Container using Docker.
+ Step 3 — Create a TMDB API Key.
+ Step 4 — Install Prometheus and Grafana On the new Server.
+ Step 5 — Install the Prometheus Plugin and Integrate it with the Prometheus server.
+ Step 6 — Email Integration With Jenkins and Plugin setup.
+ Step 7 — Install Plugins like JDK, Sonarqube Scanner, Nodejs, and OWASP Dependency Check.
+ Step 8 — Create a Pipeline Project in Jenkins using a Declarative Pipeline.
+ Step 9 — Install OWASP Dependency Check Plugins.
+ Step 10 — Docker Image Build and Push.
+ Step 11 — Deploy the image using Docker.
+ Step 12 — Kubernetes master and slave setup on Ubuntu (20.04).
+ Step 13 — Access the Netflix app on the Browser.
+ Step 14 — Terminate the AWS EC2 Instances.
